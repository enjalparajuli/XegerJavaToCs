Using xeger java library in c to generate strings based on regular expression.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary

This is for the one who wants to generate texts based on regular expression in c. In java we have a library called xeger that does this. At the time of development, I was unable to find any library in c programming that could generate texts based on a given regular expression. Thus this progam is created to implement xeger from java inside c program using JNI and leverage flexibility to your c code to generate text out of regular expression.

### Technologies Used ###
* C
* Xeger
* JNI
